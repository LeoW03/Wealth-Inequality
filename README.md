# Wealth-Inequality By Percentile

TLDR: Displays wealth distributions by percentile for any country and currency. Data from WID.


A friend mentioned in passing to me once that just about everyone we went to school with was part of the 1% in terms of wealth, which really really took me by surprise.
Of course, instead of just searching it up on Google, I decided to find the data and prove it for myself. 


This program uses Data from the World Inequality Database. Most of the code (and effort) went into cleaning and sorting the data. A lot of manual cleaning was required for databases. 

It lets you view the annual income distribution for any given country by percentile. Horrifignly, the top 0.5% of just about any country outshadows everyone else so much the graph ends up looking like a flipped-L. 

As such, I added a feature to cut out the top 1 percent :)

Additionally, you can see how an income compares to a country. Forex is used to convert currencies so the program works for any given country and currecny.

As of now, there is no front end but that may be a future project. 



To run the program you also have to download all country data from https://wid.world/data/
